///////////////////Data Flow and stuff


Types of states:
    Application state
        scoreboard eg: players and scores
    Component State
        component to function, usually only visible in component


Most of stuff so far is application states.

Application doesn't keep instance of players, just says, they should exist with these properties


    Now it re-renders the new children components with new properties when it updates

Unidirectional dataflow:
    Component uses data passed to it to pass data from children
    DATA COMES TO PARENT, CASCADES THROUGH DOM TREE TO COMPONENTS
    uses events, as callback functions, to update state
        child executes callback function, which may call other callback functions, telling the application to update

#############  Counter is stateful component right now
    back to functional component right now.
